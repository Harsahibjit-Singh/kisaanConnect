      <p>The traditional "Bahi Khata" has served Indian agriculture for centuries. But as trade volumes increase and GST compliance becomes stricter, the red ledger is struggling to keep up.</p>
      <h3>The Cost of Manual Errors</h3>
      <p>Studies show that the average Arthiya loses ₹50,000 annually due to minor calculation errors in manual ledgers. Whether it's a misplaced decimal in a commission calculation or a forgotten labor charge, these small leaks sink big ships.</p>
      <h3>Enter Kisaan Connect</h3>
      <p>By moving to a cloud-based system, you ensure that every kilogram is accounted for. Our system automatically calculates:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Market Fees (Mandi Shulk)</li>
        <li>Labor Charges (Mazdoori)</li>
        <li>Commission (Aadhat)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The future is digital, and the future is now.</p>

      <p>The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) has announced the Minimum Support Prices (MSP) for all mandated Rabi crops for the 2025-26 marketing season.</p>
      <h3>Wheat See Big Jump</h3>
      <p>The MSP for wheat has been increased by ₹150 per quintal, bringing it to ₹2,425. This is a significant move to encourage higher sowing acreage.</p>
      <h3>Impact on Arthiyas</h3>
      <p>Higher MSP means higher transaction volumes in the Mandi. Arthiyas need to be prepared with sufficient liquidity and storage space to handle the incoming rush.</p>

      <p>Lending money to farmers for seeds and fertilizers is an integral part of the Arthiya business model. However, tracking these 'advances' on paper often leads to disputes.</p>
      <h3>The Transparency Factor</h3>
      <p>When you use a digital system like Kisaan Connect, the farmer gets an SMS every time an entry is made. This builds trust. When the crop is sold, the system automatically deducts the principal + interest and prints a clear statement.</p>
